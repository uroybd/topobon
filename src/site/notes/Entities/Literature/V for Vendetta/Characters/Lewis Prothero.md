Prothero is a richly compound character.

## Characteristics
### Ex-Commander
Firstly, he is an ex-commander of the army and was a director of [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Places/Larkhill\|Larkhill]]. There we can find him particularly cruel.

### A Collector of Dolls
Contrasting to his cruelty, we can find a completely different man if we consider his obsession with collecting dolls. This came to be his undoing when [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Characters/V\|V]] used this for [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Characters/V#Lewis Prothero\|his psychological attack]].

### Voice of Fate
Prothero has a powerful, and charismatic voice which is known to the population as the voice of [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Entities/Fate\|Fate]] itself. This is particularly useful to the [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Entities/The Government\|government]] since they can exploit it to connect to the population in a more humane way.
