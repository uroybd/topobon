> [!INFO] A better approach…
> Although a little complicated, but better approach is to download the exported highlights as JSON from the Boox-cloud and use that to generate notes as we want (with rich context provided by the colour being used to highlight). You can find out how to do that [[Personal/Writings/Technical/HowTos/Boox to Obsidian_ Rich Annotation Export from Boox Cloud\|in this note]].

## Problem
One can easily export highlights and annotations from NeoReader[^1] as txt file. However, it has some very important downsides:
1. It provides very minimal metadata, nothing more than page number, chapter, and time. One can choose between multiple highlighting *styles* while reading(e.g. highlight, wavy line, or straight underline), but these data are not being exported from NeoReader. Therefore, it goes nowhere near KOReader as long as exporting feature is concerned.
2. It's really a very ugly format.

## Solution
Here's a workflow (basically a [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/) template) that made my life a little easier. It assumes some practices and setup on my part:
1. Obsidian, and Templater plugins installed.
2. Except for normal quotes, I'm starting my notes with the following symbols for added context:
    -  `!` for important notes.
    - `@` for disagreement.
    - `?` for thought-provoking things.
    - `/` for ideas I am sceptic about.
    - `~` for warning
    - `#` for stylishly written content.

Only these symbols at the beginning will be treated differently.

With this setup and practices in place, copy the content of the gist below in a markdown file to use as a template for Templater:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/uroybd/cbfce7135b8efa61964f89234e52f39d.js"></script>

To use this, all one has to do is:
1. Create an empty note.
2. Run that note as a template using templater.
3. A prompt will appear for the content. Copy the exported note's content into this prompt and proceed.
4. A prompt for total page number will appear. Input the total pages calculated in the NeoReader for accurate calculation then proceed.

It will replace the existing content with formatted content.

It even seemed, for a moment, that this love for a phrase of music would have to open in Swann the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation. He had for so long given up directing his life toward an ideal goal and limited it to the pursuit of everyday satisfactions that he believed, without ever saying so formally to himself, that this would not change as long as he lived; much worse, since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideas, he had ceased to believe in their reality, though without being able to deny it altogether.

AMONG THE BEDROOMS whose images I summoned up most often in my nights of insomnia, none resembled less the rooms at Combray, dusted with an atmosphere that was grainy, pollinated, edible, and devout, than the room at the Grand-Hôtel de la Plage, at Balbec, whose enamel-painted walls contained, like the polished sides of a swimming pool which tints the water blue, a pure azure salt sea air. The Bavarian decorator commissioned to furnish the hotel had varied the design schemes of the rooms and on three sides, along the walls, in the one I was occupying, had placed low bookcases, with glass panes, in which, depending on the spot they occupied, and by an effect he had not foreseen, one part or another of the changing picture of the sea was reflected, unfurling a frieze
