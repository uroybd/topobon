Lately, I've been familiar with three ideas. One is from the book **[[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins\|God Delusion]]** by *Richard Dawkins*. He argued that maybe religion is a side effect of other evolutionary traits which enables us to *maybe* work as a team. Then *Yuval Noah Harari* introduced me to the **knowledge illusion** in his book **[[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari\|21 Lessons for the 21st Century]]**, which enable us to believe to know something which we don't know personally but is known to someone somewhere. And in **[[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker\|Denial of Death]]** *Ernest Becker* explained that Sigmund Freud did a great work on how people rather blindly follow people in [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego by Sigmund Freud\|a book]] ~~(I have to read that)~~. It is their urge to follow someone, to feel secure, like in the arms of their parents.

Now, I wonder, are they somehow connected in the depth of our biology?

Upon further inspection, it feels like faith has some obvious biological dependencies. Our larger neocortex allows us to [[Personal/Reading/Notes and Highlights/How Religion Evolved by Robin Dunbar#^e64ec4\|be more social]]. It also allows us to [[Personal/Reading/Notes and Highlights/How Religion Evolved by Robin Dunbar#^652db9\|mentalize]] deeply nested ideas:

| Intentionality level | Possible statements of belief | Form of religion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | I believe that [rain is falling]| not possible |
| 2nd | I believe that you think [rain is falling] | not possible |
| 3rd | I believe that you think that God exists [in a transcendental world] | religious fact |
| 4th | I believe that you think that God exists and intends to punish us | personal religion |
| 5th | I believe that you think that we both know that God exists and intends to punish us | communal religion |

From the 3rd level onwards, it allows us to have religious faith. But, faiths by themselves are memes having their courses through generations by non-biological means. Although **knowledge illusion** and **group psychology** explain why someone will believe in a specific dogma in the first place, **the belief that knowledge illusion invokes is different from the faith that religious experience brings in.** Faith is more akin to schizophrenia than communal belief.
