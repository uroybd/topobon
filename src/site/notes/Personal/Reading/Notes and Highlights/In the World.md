# In the World
##### By Maxim Gorky

## CHAPTER V
### Page 90 @ March 25, 2016
On one of these occasions, however, I asked him: “Why is every one afraid of you? For you are good.”

ভালো লেখকদের একটা ব্যাপার কমন মনে হচ্ছে। তারা কথা কম বলেন, বেশি দেখেন এবং বোল্ডলি ইনোসেন্ট।

## CHAPTER XIV
### Page 244 @ April 02, 2016
It is painful to remember how many good people in my life I have seen senselessly ruined. People of all nations wear themselves out, and to ruin themselves comes natural, but nowhere do they wear themselves out so terribly quickly, so senselessly, as in our own Russia.

## CHAPTER XVI
### Page 279 @ April 04, 2016

## CHAPTER XX
### Page 341 @ April 05, 2016
Why do I relate these abominations? So that you may know, kind sirs, that is not all past and done with! You have a liking for grim fantasies; you are delighted with horrible stories well told; the grotesquely terrible excites you pleasantly. But I know of genuine horrors, everyday terrors, and I have an undeniable right to excite you unpleasantly by telling you about them,  in order that you may remember how we live, and under what circumstances. A low and unclean life it is, ours, and that is the truth! I am a lover of humanity and I have no desire to make any one miserable, but one must not be sentimental, nor hide the grim truth with the motley words of beautiful lies. Let us face life as it is!
