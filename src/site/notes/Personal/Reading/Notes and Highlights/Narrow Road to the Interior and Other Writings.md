# Notes & Highlights:  Narrow Road to the Interior and Other Writings
## Matsuo Basho (Translated by Sam Hamill)
### Translator’s Introduction
#### Time：2021-06-26 16:18
Ki-no-Tsurayuki’s co-compiler of the Kokinshū, Mibu-no-Tadamine (868–965), introduced another new term to the Japanese critical canon by praising a quality in certain poems which he called yūgen, a word borrowed from Chinese Buddhist writingto identify “depth of meaning,” a character made by combining the character for “dim” or “dark” with the character identifying a deep, reddish black color. Tadamine use dyūgen to identify “aesthetic feeling not explicitly expressed.” He wanted a term by which to identify subtleties and implications. Over the course of the next hundred or so years, yūgen would also be adopted by Zennists to define “ghostly qualities,” as in ink paintings. But the term’s origin lies within seventh-century Chinese Buddhist literary terminology. As an aesthetic concept, it was esteemed throughout the medieval period. An excellent study of Buddhism and literary arts in medieval Japan, William R. LaFleur’s The Karma of Words, devotes an entire chapter to yūgen.

The fourteenth-century Zen monk Ikkyū Sōjun wrote, “Ame furaba fure, kazefukaba fuke.” If it rains, let it rain; if the wind blows, let it blow. Bashō spent many years struggling to “learn how to listen as things speak for themselves.” No regrets. He refused to be anthropocentric.

Matsushima ya  
ah Matsushima ya  
Matsushima ya
{ #83dc7c}


This is the sort of poem that can be done once, and once only. But it is quintessentially Bashō, both playful and inspired, yet with a hint of [[Entities/Concept/Mono no aware\|Entities/Concept/Mono no aware]], a trace of the pathos of beautiful mortality. A literal translation: “PineIslands, ah! / Oh, Pine Islands, ah! / Pine Islands, ah!” Simple as it is, the poem implies co-dependent origination, physical landscape, and a breathless—almost speechless—reverence.

“Abide by rules,” Bashō taught, “then throw them out!— only then may you achieve true freedom.”

With every pilgrimage one encounters the temporality of life. To die along the road is destiny. Or so I told myself.

To have blue irises  
blooming on one’s feet—

On the eleventh day, fifth moon, we visited Zuigan Temple, and were met by the thirty-second-generation descendent of the founder. Established by Makabe-no-Heishiro at the time he returned from religious studies in T’ang China, the temple was enlarged under Ungo Zenji into seven main structures with new blue tile roofs, walls of gold, a jeweled buddha-land. But my mind wandered, wondering if the priest Kembutsu’s tiny temple might be found.

In Yamagata Province, the ancient temple founded by Jikaku Daishi in 860, Ryūshaku Temple is stone quiet, perfectly tidy. Everyone told us to see it. It meant a few miles extra, doubling back toward Obanazawa to find shelter. Monks at the foot of the mountain offered rooms, then we climbed the ridge to the temple, scrambling up through ancient gnarled pine and oak, gray smooth stones and moss. The temple doors, built on rocks, were bolted. I crawled among boulders to make my bows at shrines. The silence was profound. I sat, feeling my heart begin to open.

The winds that blow  
through South Valley Temple

Together with Moon Mountain and Bath Mountain, Feather Black Mountain completes the Dewa Sanzan, orThree Holy Mountains of Dewa. This temple is Tendai sect, like the one in Edo on Toei Hill. Both follow the doctrine of shikantaza, “deep-sitting concentration and insight,” a way of enlightenment as transparent as moonlight, its light infinitely increasing, spreading from hermitage to mountain top and back, reverence and compassion shining in everything it touches. Its blessing flows down from these mountains, enriching all our lives.

Sitting in the temple chamber with the blinds raised, we saw the whole lagoon, Mount Chōkai holding up the heavens inverted on the water. To the westthe road leads to the Muyamuya Barrier; to the east it curves along a bank toward Akita; to the north, the sea comes in on tide flats at Shiogoshi. The whole lagoon, though only a mile or so across, reminds one of Matsushima, although Matsushima seems much more contented, whereas Kisakata seems bereaved. A sadness maybe in its sense of isolation here where nature’s darker spirits hide— like a strange and beautiful woman whose heart has been broken.

At the Echizen Province border, at an inlet town called Yoshizaki, I hired a boat and sailed for the famous pines of Shiogoshi. Saigyō wrote:

All the long night  
salt-winds drive  
storm-tossed waves  
and moonlight drips  
through Shiogoshi pines.

This one poem says enough. To add another would be like adding a sixth finger to a hand.

My older brother opened a small amulet, saying, “Bow to your mother’s white hair. This is like the famous jeweled box of Urashima Tarō— your own eyebrows have already turned gray!” I wrote this after we had all shed our tears:

If I took it in hand,  
it would melt in my hot tears—  
heavy autumn frost

After twenty years, I met an old friend at Minakuchi:

While we’ve lived our lives  
they’ve survived to still blossom,  
these old cherry trees

### The Knapsack Notebook

Saigyō in poetry, Sōgi in linked verse, Sesshū in painting, Rikyū in the teaceremony— the spirit that moves them is one spirit. Achieving artistic excellence, each holds one attribute in common: each remains attuned to nature throughout the four seasons. Whatever is seen by such a heart and mind is a flower, whatever is dreamed is a moon. Only a barbarian mind could fail to see the flower; only an animal mind could fail to dream a moon. The first task for each artist is to overcome the barbarian or animal heart and mind, to become one with nature.

#### Time：2021-06-26 16:41
Mile after mile  
falls away each day I search  
for cherry blossoms

Blossoming cherries,  
a gloomy sky, and, sadly,  
one arborvitae  
My fan for a cup,  
I drink from a downpour  
of cherry blossoms.  

*Page Number:71*
#### Time：2021-06-26 16:42
Throughout my three days in Yoshino, I enjoyed the opportunity to study cherry blossoms at various hours, predawn to dusk and past midnight when the moon was growing pale. I was too moved to write even one poem, especially when my melancholy heart remembered famous poems by Saigyō and other ancient poets. All my lofty pretenses and ambitions aside, my journey produced no poetry.

### Afterword
#### Time：2021-06-26 17:50
It was during this stay in Ueno that he first began to advocate the poetic principle of karumi, “lightness,” urging his followers to “seek beauty in plain, simple, artless language” by observing ordinary things very closely. Karumi, together with existential Zen loneliness (sabi) and elegantly understated, unpretentious natural beauty (shibumi), characterize his final work. His life had been profoundly shaped by wabi, a principle as much moral as aesthetic, and which suggests a spiritual prosperity achieved through material poverty together with a deep appreciation of things old, worn, modest, and simple

*Page Number:138*
#### Time：2021-06-26 17:51
Near the end of his stay, he wrote a short prose meditation, Genjū-an-no-ki, in which he concludes, “In the end, without skill or talent, I’ve given myself over entirely to poetry. Po Chu-i labored at it until he nearly burst. Tu Fu starved rather than abandon it. Neither my intelligence nor my writing is comparable to such men. Nevertheless, in the end, we all live in phantom huts.”

*Page Number:138*
#### Time：2021-06-26 17:54
He wrote to a friend in Zeze in the spring of 1692, complaining, “Everywhere in this city I see people writing poetry to try to win prizes or notoriety. You can imagine what they write. Anything I might say to them would no doubt end in harsh words, so I pretend not to hear or see them.”

Bashō’s longtime friend Kyorai asked about the master’s jisei (death poem), and was told, “Tell anyone who asks that all of my everyday poems are my jisei.”

His fundamental teaching remained his conviction that in composing a poem, “There are two ways: one is entirely natural, in which the poem is born from within itself; the other way is to make it through the mastery of technique.” His notion of the poem being “born within itself” should under no circumstances be confused with its being self-originating. A fundamental tenet of Buddhism runs exactly to the contrary: nothing is self-originating. Bashō’s poems were in fact a natural product of his close observation of the natural relationships of people and things, our presence in “nature.” He prized sincerity and clarity and instructed, “Follow nature, return to nature, be nature.” He had learned to meet each day with fresh eyes. “Yesterday’s self is already worn out!”
