It starts as a fairy tale. A successful revolution led by animals. They are getting cozy in their new-found freedom. No one could've asked for a revolution so swift and effective.

Then, the meekness, the urge to follow returns to the most. A few became a new oligarchy, a new master, but shrewder in nature, oppressors who use the language of the oppressed against them:

# Animal Farm by George Orwell

</div>


ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS

It becomes a heart-breaking tell of universal cycle of oppression, of machinations of bluff perfect in each iteration, of power— absolute, corrupting power.

The ensuing rebellion under the leadership of the pigs Napoleon and Snowball leads to the animals taking over the farm. Vowing to eliminate the terrible inequities of the farmyard, the renamed Animal Farm is organized to benefit all who walk on four legs. But as time passes, the ideals of the rebellion are corrupted, then forgotten. And something new and unexpected emerges… Animal Farm—the history of a rebellion that went wrong—is George Orwell’s brilliant satire on the corrupting influence of power. ‘Remains our great satire of the darker face of modern history’ – Malcolm Bradbury. All animals are equal. But some animals are more equal than others.
