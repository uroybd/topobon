> [!info] About What I Believe by Bertrand Russell
><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=NrLPSgtYepwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;width: 150px; height: auto;" /> Along with Why I Am Not a Christian, this essay must rank as the most articulate example of Russell's famed atheism. It is also one of the most notorious. Used as evidence in a 1940 court case in which Russell was declared unfit to teach college-level philosophy, What I Believe was to become one of his most defining works. The ideas contained within were and are controversial, contentious and - to the religious - downright blasphemous. A remarkable work, it remains the best concise introduction to Russell's thought.
