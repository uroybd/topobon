> [!HINT] Impressions
> Precision, philosophical, expansive, intricate, not-so-pop science.

The first thing I noticed about this book is the scientific precision, to be specific. The images are only the vehicle of bigger ideas and are minimal in composition. The prose is seldom descriptive of the environment. Tantalising technologies almost play no role in this work. Instead, their implications have been discussed heavily.

Like any sophisticated science-fiction, this one makes philosophy *story-able*. And that storyscape unfurled over a large expanse of space and time.
