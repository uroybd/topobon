I have read quite a few #dystopian novels. Some of them are the archetypes of this genre. **NONE** have moved me as much as Fahrenheit 451 did.

A significant part of such affectation is personal. In my three decades spanning life of mine, reading is the most consistent thing. Yes, I have a society (primarily consists of my wife and long-dead writers). Yes, I have had enough diversions like gaming in cybercafés till fainting and vomiting. But, for at least 25 years, I am reading and I never quit it. While I remain as ignoramus as ever and quite a more confused than I was as a child, it became a part of my identity.

So, in a world where there aren't any books, and reading is a criminal act, I, surely am, doomed. As if, I felt the horror of it in my bones.

Many good dystopian works shares an aspect with satires— exaggeration. This is often intentional. After all, we are painting a future here, and we know very little about future. Authors often exaggerate what they know to project what can be. So, in 1953, this might sound incredible:

<u>Picture it. Nineteenth-century man with his horses, dogs, carts, slow motion. Then, in the twentieth century, speed up your camera. Books cut shorter. Condensations, Digests. Tabloids. Everything boils down to the gag, the snap ending. " "Snap ending. " Mildred nodded. "Classics cut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a ten- or twelve-line dictionary resume. I exaggerate, of course. The dictionaries were for reference. But many were those whose sole knowledge of Hamlet (you know the title certainly, Montag; it is probably only a faint rumour of a title to you, Mrs. Montag) whose sole knowledge, as I say, of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbours. Do you see? Out of the nursery into the college and back to the nursery; there's your intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more.</u>

In twenty-first century, it doesn't sound so far from truth with apps like Blinkist. Another such prophetic paragraph is this:

Without books, and full of *non-combustible data*, with walls of drawing room covered with large TVs, the citizens are living in a blissful [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord\|society of the spectacles]] where even thinking is commodity. Faber pointed out the emptiness of such a society:

<u>"I don't talk things, sir, " said Faber. "I talk the meaning of things. I sit here and know I'm alive."</u>

But, I may retract the *blissful* part. It is surely decaying. One sign of that is the attraction to violent outlets of expressions like extreme sports in the teenagers. It will surely collapse since most don't know how to handle advanced technology anymore.

With global literacy declining qualitatively, we are already observing some of these effects even now. While the book ends with a mildly hopeful note, I am not sure about our reality.

Today its message has grown more relevant than ever before. Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.
