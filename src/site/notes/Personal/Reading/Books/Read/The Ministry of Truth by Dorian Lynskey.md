This is a book about a book. Not any random book, but the [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/1984 by George Orwell\|1984]], and the writer George Orwell himself. Both of them are phenomenally famous, ambiguous, and misinterpreted.
  
If one loses sight of Orwell's politics (he was a Democratic Socialist), his background, struggles, and disillusionment ([[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/Homage to Catalonia by George Orwell\|Homage to Catalonia]] is what one needs), it is natural to think that it was a pro-capitalist book to undermine socialism.  
  
This book deals with this misconception and many others. A chronicle that starts from conceiving the book to finishing it, and then, the ever-transforming socio-cultural effect it had on his time, and times after that. To make his point, Minsky did his homework well.
