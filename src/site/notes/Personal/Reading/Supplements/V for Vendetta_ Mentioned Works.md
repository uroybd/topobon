> The multiplying villanies of nature
> Do swarm upon him.
>…
> And Fortune, on his damned quarry smiling,
> Showed like a rebel's whore. But all's too weak,
> For brave Macbeth — well he deserves that name
> Disdaining fortune with his brandished steel
> Which smoked with bloody execution,
> Like Valor's minion carved out his passage
> Till he faced the slave,
> Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
