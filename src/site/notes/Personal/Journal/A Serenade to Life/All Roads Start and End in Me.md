[[Entities/Person/Matsuo Bashō\|Bashō]] Asked me to join in. I picked up my bag and my sandals. We went through the mountains and valleys towards Kyoto. The narrow road to the interior, it is called. Interior to my being.

Along the way, joined Dostoyevsky, a veritable madman. We met Attar along the way, [[Entities/Concept/Sufism/Fana\|Fanā]] to his bone. All my friends are quite mad, to be honest. 

In a Tasca in Lisbon, we met [[Entities/Person/Fernando Pessoa\|Pessoa]] and [[Entities/Person/Jibanananda Das\|Jibanananda]]. We answered the riddles of the absurd Sphinx and passed by the impenetrable castle. Evening approached with a [[Entities/Mood/Hüzün\|Huzun]] on Lisbon, blown away from Istanbul.

[[Entities/Person/Rabindranath Tagore\|Rabindranath]] never came only as himself. Sometimes, he is the *Dadathakur*, sometimes he is the *Acharya*, sometimes a child lost in the darkness of a staircase.
