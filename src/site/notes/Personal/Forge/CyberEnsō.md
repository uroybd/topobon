![Today's CyberEnso](https://enso.utsob.me/daily-source.jpg)

A few years back, I had an encounter with _[Ensō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ens%C5%8D)_ a distinctive form of art found amongst the Zen practitioners. To create one, one has to free his body from mind and draw a circle in ideally one stroke (or two sometimes). It can be either an open or a closed circle, and they mean different things. While this art form is not exactly contemporary, it is modern in the sense that it negates the interpretative aspect of art criticism.[^1] Meditation plays a far much greater role here than the techniques of producing the art.

This led me to an idea to build a Generative Art based on Ensō which I named [CyberEnsō](https://enso.utsob.me/).

### How Does it Work?
To draw an Ensō, one must _free one's mind of thoughts_, then _let one's body take control, and _allow it to create a circle— momentous, signifying the phenomenon of life itself instead of a conscious intention_.

CyberEnsō can be considered a means to do so. One has to free one's mind of thought and CyberEnsō takes that thought as the input. Then, it **[hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)** it, which is a destructive process, adds some randomness to it and produces a unique circle. The computer here is just like a calligraphy brush. With the hashing and randomness, a body in [mu-shin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushin_(mental_state)) state has as much control over it as it has on a brush.

[^1]: The practice of drawing Ensō is a part of [Hitsuzendō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitsuzend%C5%8D#Philosophical_background) or the 'Way of Zen through brush'.
